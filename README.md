Write a program that prints the letter X composed of asterisks (*). Your output should look like this: 

```cs
*   *
 * *

*   *
```

- ✓ Question 2
 Write a program that converts 10, 50, and 100 kilograms to pounds (1 lb = 0.454 kg).

- ✓ Question 3
Update the previous program to accept the weights in kilograms from the user.

- ✓ Question 4
Write a program that converts 2, 5, and 10 inches to millimeters (1 inch = 25.4 mm).

- ✓ Question 5
Update the previous program to accept the lengths in inches from the user.

- ✓ Question 6
Write a program to compute and output the circumference of a circle having a radius of 3.2 inches

```cs
C = 2 
    - C: The circumference of the circle.
    - r: The radius of the circle.
```

- ✓ Question 7
Update the previous program to accept the radius from the user. Use the entered value to calculate and output the circle's circumference and area.

```cs
A = pie r^2
    - A: The area of the circle.
    - r: The radius of the circle.
```

- ✓ Question 8
Write a program that reads two words representing passwords from the keyboard and outputs the number of characters in the smaller of the two. For example, if the two words are open and sesame, then the output should be 4, the length of the shorter word, open.

- ✓ Question 9
Write a program that prompts the user for a domain name. Your program should then concatenate that name with www. and .com in order to form an Internet domain name and output the result. For instance, if the name entered by the user is yahoo, then the output will be www.yahoo.com.

- ✓ Question 11
Write a program that accepts a number as an input, then computes and outputs the cube of that number.

- ✓ Question 12
Write a program that reads a file name from the keyboard. You should expect that the file name has one . (dot) character in it, separating the file name from the file extension. Retrieve the file extension and output it. For instance, if the user inputs index.html, you should output html; if the user inputs MyClass.java, you should output java.

Write a program that reads three integer values from the keyboard representing, respectively, a number of quarters, dimes, and nickels. Convert the total coin amount to dollars and output the result with a dollar notation.

- ✓ Question 14
Write a program that accepts three integers from the user, calculates the average, and prints the result to one decimal place.

- ✓ Question 15
Write a program that reads two integers from the keyboard: one representing the number of shots taken by a basketball player, the other representing the number of shots made by the same player. Calculate the shooting percentage and output it with the percent notation.

- Question 16
Write a program that reads two numbers from the keyboard representing, respectively, an investment (present value) and an interest rate (you will expect the user to enter a number such as .065 for the interest rate, representing a 6.5% interest rate).
